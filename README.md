# Harmonograph
A virtual harmonograph written in processing.

This is a processing sketch (program) run with the processing environment (https://processing.org/).

This file creates a visual representation of the output of a hamonograph (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph).

Go tinker and break it if you have to but remember to have fun and learn something along the way.
